Maternal health risk prediction involves developing models or systems that can assess the risk of complications or adverse outcomes during pregnancy and childbirth for expecting mothers. The objective is to identify high-risk individuals early on, enabling healthcare providers to intervene with appropriate care and interventions to improve maternal and fetal health outcomes.

The prediction models consider various factors that contribute to maternal risk, including medical history, age, pre-existing conditions, prenatal care utilization, lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health. Machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques are often utilized to analyze large datasets and identify patterns or risk factors associated with adverse maternal outcomes.

By accurately predicting maternal health risks, healthcare providers can implement targeted monitoring, interventions, and treatment plans to mitigate potential complications. This may involve closer monitoring of high-risk individuals, personalized care plans, early intervention strategies, and education to promote healthy behaviors during pregnancy.

Maternal health risk prediction aims to reduce maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, and improve overall maternal health by enabling early identification and management of high-risk pregnancies. By providing healthcare providers with valuable insights, it supports informed decision-making and ensures that appropriate care is delivered to those who need it most, thus safeguarding the well-being of both mothers and their babies.
